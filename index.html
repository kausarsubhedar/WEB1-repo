    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
         composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron. H for hydrogen. and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i>
    Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
    2H<sub>2</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<dfn>H<sub>2</sub></dfn>) and oxygen gas (<dfn>O<sub>2</sub></dfn>) to form water (<dfn>H<sub>2</sub>O</dfn>).</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>subscripts</sub>indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>conclusion</h5>
    Chemistry plays a crucial role in sunderstanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
